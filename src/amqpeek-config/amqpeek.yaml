# Queues to monitor.
#
# Define a queue you wish to monitor and the warning limit of that queue
# An alternative to defining queues is queue_limits below.
#
# limit:
# max items in queue before notification is sent
queues:
  my_queue: {
      'limit': 10
  }

  my_other_queue: {
      'limit': 10

  my_other_other_queue: {

# Limits and associated queues.
#
# Define a number of queues grouped by limit.
#
# This is an alternative approach to
# defining queues individually, as shown above.
#
# key:
# max items in queue before notification is sent
#
# value:
# list of queue names to apply the limit to
queue_limits:
  10: ['my_queue', 'my_other_queue']
